# Better Student Center

PeopleSoft's Student Center is an old piece of technology. It is generally unfriendly to use and lacks a mobile site. It makes it difficult to find out extensive information about courses in which you are enrolled, and it formats schedules in a rather unattractive way.

To address these problems, I am creating this as a wrapper around the existing student center. It will make the site much easier to navigate on both mobile and desktop platforms.
